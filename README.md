# Scratch Machine Learning

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch, without using any pre-built libraries or frameworks. The algorithms included in this repository are:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


After installing the dependencies, you can run the implementations for each algorithm by executing the corresponding Python script in the `src` directory. For example, to run the Linear Regression implementation, navigate to the `src` directory and execute the following command:

`python linear_regression.py`



## Examples

Each algorithm implementation includes an example of how to use it on a sample dataset. You can find these examples in the `examples` directory. To run an example, navigate to the corresponding subdirectory and execute the following command:

`python example.py`
